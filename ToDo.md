# To Do

This file is for listing the to-do items that still need to be addressed in this repo.

Not to be confused with the `TODO:` comments in many of these files.

In no particular order:

1.  styling - add css files.

2.  Add sorting of the list(s). Starting with:

    1. chronological/reverse chronological order
    2. and alphabetical/reverse alphabetical order.

3.  Add filtering to those list(s).

4.  Improve performance by integrating `PropTypes` and/or `TypeScript`.

5.  Create a component(s) that

    1. creates an additional list,
    2. edits the name of the list,
    3. deletes the list

    As a stretch goal, functionality to

    1. add additional field(s) to that new list,
    2. edit the name of those field(s),
    3. and deletes those fields.

6.  Make this app accessible.

7.  Establish a local version on my mobile.

8.  Host it online for anyone to access.
